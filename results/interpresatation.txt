Got it üëç Let‚Äôs break down what these evaluation metrics mean for your model:

---

### üìä **Results for Robert-Base**

* **`eval_loss`: 3.1345**
  The cross-entropy loss is relatively high (lower is better). This suggests the model is struggling to fit the data.

* **`eval_accuracy`: 56.4%**
  The model gets about half of the samples correct. Depending on the number of classes and the baseline (random guessing), this may or may not be meaningful.

  * Example: if you have 2 classes, random guessing gives \~50%, so 56% is only slightly better than chance.
  * If you have many classes (say 10+), then 56% is a decent signal.

* **`eval_precision`: 0.0011 (0.11%)**
  Extremely low. Out of all the positive predictions, almost none were correct. The model is misclassifying a lot.

* **`eval_recall`: 0.00195 (0.2%)**
  Extremely low. Out of all true positives, the model is barely identifying any. Suggests the model is missing almost everything relevant.

* **`eval_f1`: 0.0014**
  Since both precision and recall are near zero, F1 score is also near zero. This indicates the model ba Msically failed at detecting the positive class.

### ‚è± Performance

* **Runtime**: 2215 seconds (\~37 minutes) for evaluation.
* **Samples/sec**: 1.276 ‚Üí very slow evaluation throughput. Could be due to:

  * Large model size
  * Running on CPU (not GPU/TPU)
  * Large input sequence length
  * Inefficient dataloader setup

---

### üîé **Interpretation**

* Your model seems to **predict the majority class most of the time**. That explains why **accuracy is non-trivial (56%)**, but **precision/recall are near zero**.
* This usually happens in **imbalanced datasets** (e.g., one class dominates) or when the model hasn‚Äôt trained long enough.

### ‚úÖ **Next Steps**

1. **Check class distribution** ‚Äì Is the dataset imbalanced? If yes:

   * Use weighted loss (`class weights`) or oversampling.
   * Evaluate per-class metrics instead of just global averages.

2. **Train for more epochs** ‚Äì You only did **1 epoch**. For most NLP tasks, 3‚Äì5+ epochs are needed before metrics stabilize.

3. **Learning rate & batch size** ‚Äì High loss and poor precision/recall could mean:

   * LR is too high ‚Üí model not converging.
   * Batch size too small/large ‚Üí unstable gradients.

4. **Check evaluation metric setup** ‚Äì If it's multi-class classification, confirm whether precision/recall/F1 are being averaged (`macro`, `micro`, or `weighted`). Sometimes `micro` can hide performance issues.

---

üëâ In summary:
Your model is doing only slightly better than chance (accuracy 56%), but failing to capture the positive class (precision/recall ‚âà 0). This points to **class imbalance or undertraining** as the main issues.

Do you want me to suggest **specific training adjustments (config changes)** to fix this quickly?
